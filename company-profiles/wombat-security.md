# Wombat Security Technologies

## Company blurb

Today the company name is Proofpoint Security Awareness Training. In March 2018, Wombat Security Technologies realized an exciting milestone: our acquisition by Proofpoint, a leading next-generation security and compliance company. Now we’ve reached another landmark moment: the evolution of the Wombat brand to Proofpoint Security Awareness Training.

But Wombat was born from research at the world-renowned Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). Our company was founded in June 2008 by Drs. Norman Sadeh, Jason Hong, and Lorrie Cranor — all faculty members at the CMU School of Computer Science.
