## Company blurb

The digital health designers. We help health and wellness companies deliver customer-centered digital experiences.

Something big is happening in the health industry. Health is no longer confined to the walls of the doctor's office. Whether monitoring their sleep habits, diet or managing a chronic illness, your customers are taking their health into their own hands—and they're expecting you to keep up.

That's why it matters that you provide them with digital experiences that they love and trust. Here at Hanno, we take care of everything from product marketing and strategy, right the way through to designing, building and launching life-changing digital products.

Health is our sweet spot—working across multiple industries, we get how technology shapes behaviour, putting us in a unique place to help you navigate the growing demand and expectation for digital health services.

For the last 7 years we’ve been on a mission to become one of the world’s best fully-distributed teams—creating a truly humanised work culture and finding the right balance between challenge and freedom in everything we do. We don’t burden ourselves with offices and commuter hell. Everyone at Hanno has the freedom to base themselves out of whichever location they desire, as long as they have a reliable and professional setup—whether that’s a dedicated co-working space or a studio in their home.

## Company technologies

Our current stack is based on the latest version of JavaScript, EcmaScript 2015 (or ES6). When not working with node.js (which already supports a lot of ES6 features), we transpile ES6 code using Babel.
As a build tool, we mainly use Webpack, but also have experience using Gulp and Grunt. With the release of Webpack 2, which has a strong community, extensive plugin system and huge flexibility, we advocate for using it on most our projects.
Depending on the project needs, we typically use either React or Angular. Both are great options, and our choice usually comes down to the needs of the project.
Even though React is just a view layer for your app, it has a great ecosystem many add-ons for the model/controller layer to build more complex apps, such as Redux or MobX.
By contrast, Angular comes with a lot of pre-defined structure and tells you how to lay out your app and components. It also enables developers to write more HTML-like code with React and is a great choice when prototyping app ideas quickly.

## Office locations

As a remote team, we don't have a physical base.
