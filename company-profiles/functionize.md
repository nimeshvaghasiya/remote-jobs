## Company size

50-75

## Remote status

We mostly use Slack to communicate, but we also use Zoom for meetings. Other than those two, we use Atlassian products (Jira, Confluence, Bitbucket) for project management, version control, etc.

Since there is no office location, everyone is remote, which definitely levels the playing field.
