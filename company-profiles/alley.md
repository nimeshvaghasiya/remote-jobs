## Company blurb

Alley is a team of strategists, researchers, designers, and developers who craft custom digital experiences for publishers, nonprofit institutions, museums, and brands. We provide industry-leading software development, user experience and visual design, data visualization, editorial workflow strategy, and accessibility consulting. We look at our work in terms of products, not projects. We collaborate with you for the long term to improve your product as we learn what your audience needs. We empower you to succeed in an ever-changing landscape of new technologies and distribution channels.

We use open-source technologies such as WordPress and React to give clients the power, security, and support they need to succeed. We pride ourselves on a collaborative design and development practice, organized with Scrum, that produces fast, accessible, and refined products that work better for your team and your community.

Our clients are major influencers of public and industry opinion, including People, the Brookings Institution, and the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. Letâ€™s do launch.
