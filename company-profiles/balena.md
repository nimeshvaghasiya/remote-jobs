# Balena

## Company blurb

Balena’s mission is to unlock the potential of physical computing by removing friction for IoT device fleet owners. We believe that edge computing is the next major computing paradigm, and every new computing paradigm needs a scalable development platform to match. We’re building that platform by focusing on removing any barrier preventing mainstream developers from being successful.

The [balena](https://balena.io/) platform simplifies device fleet management, so developers can focus on their product, not their infrastructure. We provide tools that make it easy for any developer to build applications for IoT and the Edge, this means we work on the entire stack, including the hardware!
