# Gitbook

## Company blurb

GitBookâ€™s ambition is to modernise how we share and leverage knowledge for teams.

GitBook first started in mid-2014 as an open source project. The original idea was to create a desktop collaborative app allowing users to create, edit and share technical docs. 

Observing the large usage of docs such as personal notes or product docs, we wanted to push the original idea further. Thus, gitbook.com was created allowing users to host their own content wether its personal notes, knowledge bases or product docs. 

Our mission is to make a user-friendly and collaborative product for everyone to use in order to create, edit and share knowledge through documentation across technical and non technical teams.

GitBook is now sustained by some of the best SaaS europeans VCs (Point 9 Capital, Notion Capital, Fly VC), used by over 500,000 users and thousands of companies such as Adobe (product doc), Decathlon (internal knowledge base), or Google (internal knowledge base).
