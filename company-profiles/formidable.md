# Formidable

## Company blurb

Formidable is a Seattle, Denver, Phoenix, and London-based engineering consultancy and open source software organization, specializing in React.js, React Native, GraphQL, Node.js, and the extended JavaScript ecosystem.

We practice "consulting through delivery", and our teams of engineers embed remotely with client engineers, product managers, and designers. We have a heavy focus on code review and testing. Our clients reach out to us because we have developed hard-earned expertise in our areas of focus, and our engineers are trusted with the architecture of very large-scale systems. We plug into whatever agile methodology our clients use, though after observing the workflow for a while, we provide suggestions for improvements via retrospectives.

Everyone at Formidable help to foster a culture of supportive learning and knowledge exchange, both within our company and throughout the greater JavaScript community. We work hard to live our core values of Inclusion, Autonomy, and Mastery:

- We have an internally open pay system tied to a detailed career ladder to promote transparency around pay and engineering levels, and keep the company accountable for equal pay for equal work.
- We trust our employees to do the jobs we hired them to do. Each team is responsible for making their own decisions and coming up with the appropriate solutions for their particular project.
- We provide a bottomless continuing education stipend and internal trainings to help our employees skill up.

## Company size

75+

## Remote status

We have an entire remote team throughout the US and building a remote Toronto-based Canada team. We collaborate via Slack, Github (or the DVCS of our clients' choice), and video calls.

We consider Remote to be a first-class location, and we have remote engineering managers. We provide a travel stipend to encourage visits to our physical offices, but it's not required. We have an annual "Formidagathering" where everyone gets together for a week in Seattle to learn, play, socialize, and work together.

Though we hire entry-level engineers in our physical locations, we recognize that folks early in their career need more hands-on mentorship, something that's harder to provide to remote employees. That's why we require that our remote engineers have 2-3 years of professional experience.
