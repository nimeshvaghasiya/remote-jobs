# Evil Martians

## Company blurb

[Evil Martians](https://evilmartians.com/) is a distributed product development consultancy that works with startups and established businesses, and creates open source-based products and services.

Clients trust us to be the core technical team behind their startups, delivering all elements of successful product work: user interface design backed by analytics, agile software development, infrastructure administration, and service reliability. We pay extra attention to mentoring, making sure that the practices we bring in are adopted by the internal team before our collaboration is over. 

Martian intervention proves effective for startups that are pivoting or experiencing explosive growth. We work with seed-stage and series A/B startups, Y Combinator alumni, as well as with more established internet companies doing “internal startups.” Clients come to Evil Martians for our technological expertise proven by recommendations from CEOs and venture capitalists, our success in product development, and our open source experience and culture.

Our open source products include PostCSS and Autoprefixer (front-end tools used by major startups and internet-based companies), imgproxy, AnyCable, Astrograph and a plethora of libraries for Ruby, JavaScript, and other languages. We regularly “tour,” giving keynotes at key technical conferences and local meetups.
