# Memory

## Company blurb

How smart can artificial intelligence make us? Memory consists of 45 people and we're on the hunt for 25 new colleagues to help answer that question.

AI performs extremely well at the same things humans are bad at, and vice versa. Processing enormous amounts of information, finding patterns and predicting new ones – in the speed of light. Perfect for an AI, impossible for a human.

That's why we're building a Memory-database. On top of that we're creating tools that will give humans digital superpowers. A kind of glue between you and the future. A glue between you and everyone. A glue that knows everything and that can separate the signal from the noise, every-single-second.

Our first real-world product is [Timely](https://timelyapp.com/), a completely automatic time tracking service.
