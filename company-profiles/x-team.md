Taken from their [fb](https://www.facebook.com/x.team/) page:
_"X-Teamers work with just about every at least semi-mainstream stack. Generally speaking, a majority of the projects we’re working on have React as the frontend, with the backend running on Node, or to a lesser degree Laravel or Symfony. Of course, there have also been projects with Vue, Angular, and even a rare Elm frontend. On the backend, Golang, Java, and Python also aren’t unheard of. Android and iOS are also in the mix, both natively and through cross-platform tech like Xamarin and React Native. And who could get anything done in 2018 without Docker and AWS?"_
